Is it really that good?\nAshley: It's the best thing I've ever read! Completely life-changing! It's opened my eyes to a lot of things.\nSeamus: Sorry, but I don't like books that are written to change my life. I prefer books that are simply fun to read :P\nMarcus: I get what you mean. I feel like some authors are so concentrated on making their books full of wisdom that they completely forget that they should also be readable.\nErin: Do you mean Coelho? XD\nMarcus: No, while I'm not a fan of his, at least I've never fallen asleep while reading his books. I meant this one for example: <file_other>\nAshley: Erm, I quite like his books.\nSeamus: Did they change your life too? :D\nAshley: Wait, I meant Coelho. I've never read the other guy.\nMarcus: Trust me, don't. There are lots of better ways of wasting your time.\nAshley: LOL, okay, I trust you. But the one I posted at the beginning is really good. It's not just some philosophical gibberish, it's actually a crime novel, so there's a lot of action too.\nErin: Does it have a cute detective? ;)\nAshley: Even two of them, actually. Believe me, you won't be able to decide which one to love more!\nErin: Okay, I'm already sold :D",
